#+html: <p align="center"><strong>Raiden.</strong> An attack injection framework for Veins, which builds on SUMO.</p>

** Getting Started

   Raiden has been tested on the standard Veins 5.0 OVA
   for Virtualbox 6.1.

*** Veins

    The project relies on [[https://veins.car2x.org/][Veins]], the easiest way
    to run Veins repeatably is
    to download the instant OVA used with Virtualbox.
    You could also install [[https://github.com/eclipse/sumo/][SUMO]], [[https://omnetpp.org/][OMNeT++]], and Veins
    from [[https://veins.car2x.org/tutorial/][scratch]].

*** Raiden

    Clone this repo at some location where it makes sense.
